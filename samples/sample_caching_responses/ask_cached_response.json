{"question":"How does lead time influence the likelihood of cancellations","generated_answer":"Longer lead times for bookings are associated with a higher cancellation rate, with a notable increase when booking more than 30 days in advance. In fact, the cancellation rate jumps to as high as 34.76% for long-term bookings exceeding 30 days. This suggests that the longer an individual commits to a travel or event plan, the more likely they are to cancel at some point before the scheduled date.","faithfullness":0.75,"response_time":"0.030 seconds","cached":true}

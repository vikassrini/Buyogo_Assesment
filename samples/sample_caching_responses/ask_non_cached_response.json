{"question":"Which deposit type has the highest cancellation rate","generated_answer":"Non-refundable deposits have the highest cancellation rate among different types of bookings, with a staggering 94.70% of these bookings being cancelled. This is significantly higher than refundable deposit bookings, which have a much lower cancellation rate of 24.30%. In contrast, long-term bookings (those with a lead time of more than 30 days) also have a high cancellation rate of 34.76%, but this is not as high as non-refundable deposits.","faithfullness":1.0,"response_time":"14.265930652618408 seconds"}
